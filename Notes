MethodOverloading:
allows a class to define multiple methods with the same method name but different signatures
how to have different signatures:
 => change number of parameters that a method takes
 => change dataTypes of parameters
 => change the sequence of parameters
why should we overload?
1.) cleanliness
2.) increases the readability of the program
3.) we don't have to memorize a lot of method names if we are performing the same operation

Signature of a Method => name of method + parameter
